<p>Self-monitoring devices that accurately observe and quantify changes to the body over time show promise in promoting awareness of one's health status. These technologies can provide a powerful tool for gaining personal insight into the physiological states of the body, thereby encouraging positive behavioral and lifestyle changes. Monitoring food intake, weight and physical activity is a proven behavior therapy technique that can aid in weight loss and weight maintenance programs, promoting improved health and well-being.</p>
<p>This feature requires that employers offer to each employee for his/her personal use a self-monitoring device that accurately measures and tracks biomarkers associated with occupant health and wellness, including, but not limited to, heart rate variability, sleep quality and duration, activity levels and body mass.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
