<p>Over 42 million adults in the U.S. and over a billion individuals worldwide are cigarette smokers. In the U.S. alone, smoking tobacco is related to over 400,000 premature annual deaths. Furthermore, the average life expectancy of a smoker is 10 years less than that of a non-smoker. In addition to nicotine, cigarettes contain about 600 ingredients that form over 7,000 compounds when burned, of which at least 69 are known to be carcinogenic. Secondhand smoke exposes non-smokers to the same toxins, increasing the number of people subject to health risks from smoking.</p>
<p>This feature bans smoking in and around buildings, which requires the implementation of policies to prohibit smoking indoors and adjacent to the building, along with signage to educate individuals about its harmful effects.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
