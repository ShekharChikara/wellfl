<p>Some of the chemicals used in building materials have not been fully evaluated for safety and may carry potential health risks. Off-gassing from such materials can contribute to SBS (sick building syndrome) and associated respiratory, neurotoxic and dermatologic symptoms. A precautionary approach—taking reasonable steps to minimize risks and avoid hazards—suggests substituting potentially dangerous materials with safe ones when possible. Various voluntary programs in the market allow suppliers that have carefully screened the composition of their products and avoided potentially harmful substances to be recognized for their achievements.</p>
<p>This feature promotes the use of products that have been independently verified to be free of many suspected hazards.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
