<p>Regular cleaning is an important practice as it helps to remove potentially harmful debris and maintain a healthy indoor environment. However, numerous chemicals and improper cleaning techniques can undermine indoor air quality. Harmful ingredients in cleaning products can lead to eye, nose, throat and skin irritation, and emit VOCs into the indoor environment, which may lead to other health effects including sick building syndrome (SBS). An adequate cleaning regimen using non-toxic, hypoallergenic cleaners helps to reduce bioloads, pests, environmental allergens and unpleasant odors without introducing chemicals that might adversely impact indoor air quality.</p>
<p>This feature incorporates the development of a written protocol, in accordance with Table A4 in Appendix C, including the frequency, supplies, equipment, procedures and training to improve cleaning regimens.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
