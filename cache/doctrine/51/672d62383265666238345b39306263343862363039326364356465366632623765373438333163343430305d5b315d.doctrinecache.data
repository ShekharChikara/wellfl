<p>Approximately one billion pounds of pesticides are used in a typical year in the U.S. alone. Pesticides and herbicides contaminate rivers and streams, and seep into groundwater through runoff. A U.S. Geological Survey conducted in the 1990s detected pesticide compounds in virtually every stream in agricultural, urban and mixed-use areas, as well as in over 50 percent of sampled wells assessing ground water in agricultural and urban areas. Atrazine, one of the most widely used pesticides, is a suspected endocrine disruptor and is associated with cardiovascular problems. Long-term exposure to glyphosate, a widely used herbicide, may lead to kidney problems and reproductive difficulties.</p>
<p>This feature requires the creation of pest management systems that reduce pesticide and herbicide use and eliminate highly toxic chemicals. Most pest management systems do not prohibit the application of harmful chemicals, so this feature further requires that only approved products are used.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
