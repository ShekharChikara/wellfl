<p>Air quality is subject to variability due to weather, dust, traffic and localized pollutant sources. Seasonal variations in pollen can trigger asthma and allergies in sensitive individuals. Similarly, exposure to high levels of coarse and fine particulate matter introduced from the outside can lead to respiratory irritation and has been associated with increases in lung cancer as well as cardiovascular disease and mortality.</p>
<p>This feature requires proper filtration to achieve reliable air quality performance over time. Carbon filters are designed to absorb volatile pollutants and remove the largest particles, while media filters are meant to address smaller particles. This feature is especially important when outdoor air quality routinely fails the pollutant concentrations outlined in the WELL Air Quality Standards feature. Like all of WELL, projects may submit alternative strategies to meet the intent of this feature.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
