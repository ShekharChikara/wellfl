<p>An air flush or building flush is a technique whereby air is forced through a building after construction and prior to occupancy in order to remove or reduce pollutants, such as VOCs and particulate matter, inadvertently introduced indoors during construction. Air flushing improves indoor air quality by limiting the exposure to an intense contamination period.</p>
<p>This feature requires an air flush at the completion of construction activities in order to effectively remove pollutants from indoor environments. Given the time required to conduct a flush, emphasis should be placed on the management of construction pollution as the first priority.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
