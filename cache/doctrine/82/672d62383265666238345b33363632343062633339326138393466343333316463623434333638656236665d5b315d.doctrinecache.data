<p>Organizations that espouse fair, equitable and just treatment toward their workforce help create a culture of reduced stress and greater employee satisfaction, as well as a heightened sense of loyalty. Research shows that high levels of perceived justice in the decision making process at work are correlated with a lower risk of poor health, whereas declining levels of perceived justice can in turn increase such risk. By transparently sharing their policies and investment decisions, organizations not only allow employees, clients and patrons to determine if their personal values are shared by the organization, but also provide them the opportunity to voice their opinion about the organization's social equity practices.</p>
<p>This feature uses JUST participation and G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to support fair and equitable organizations.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
